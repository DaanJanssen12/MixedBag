                <p>In this game there are some fun mechanics that are worth mentioning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 new typings added: Light & Sound</li>
                    <li>You can battle the gym leaders in any order</li>
                    <li>Difficulty settings: Easy, Normal, Hard</li>
                    <li>Build-in randomizer to randomize your game (includes pokemon from gen 1 to 8)</li>
                    <li>Easy access to rare candies (for when doing challenge runs for example)</li>

                <p>So far it's 1 person working on the game in his free time, so the development can be a bit slow at times. If you want to help with anything then feel free to contact us via mail! Help can be provided for basically anything, things like: map design, battle design, sprite work, giving suggestions for existing fakemon (stats, typeings, names, moves, etc..). Any help will be greatly appreciated!</p>
