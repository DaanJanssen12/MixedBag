          <p>In this game there are some options to customize your game to meet your own preferences. Here are some things you can do:</p>
          <h4>Difficulty</h4>
          <p>At the very start of the game when you talk to your mother for the first time you can choose the game's difficulty. The options are: Easy, Medium & Hard. </br></br> This impacts the level scaling, the teams of the gym leaders and even how smart the AI is.</p>
          
          <h4>Randomizer</h4>
          <p>The game has a built-in randomizer. When you click on the game console in your house you can access the randomizer settings. This includes randomizing: Static pokemon, Wild pokemon, Trainer pokemon, Items, Abilities. </br></br>
          When randomizing Pokemon, all pokemon from gen 1 untill 9 will be included.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Free rare candies</h4>
          <p>When you click on the game console in your house you can access the randomizer settings. After the questions about the randomizer you get the question if you want to be able to access free rare candies. If you select yes then in every Pokemart there will be a 2nd clerk who gives you 99 rare candies when you talk to him.
